## Feedback

Your work is so pretty, I'll just do a new feedback file. On the `submission.md`, I'm a little surprised by the variation in local nulls. I don't 
think I've seen that from others, though lots of people had `trans_status` variance. Otherwise everything looks good. 

### Task 1

* This is a clever line `clean_headers = [i.replace('"', '') for i in headers]`
* Instead of `line[0] == "datetime"`, I like doing `'datetime' in line` (before you split it). It's not entirely obvious to me that your code works as designed, if the quotes are around "datetime", but I'm sure it's fine. 
* Everything else here looks great. 

### Task 2

Nice work, this is very clean and easy to read. You have more empty lines in your cells than I'd expect, fwiw.

### Task 3

This code also looks great. I feel like `queryN` is not an amazing name for your tables, but other than that I don't see any areas of improvement. 

Nice work, this is complete! 🎉🥳🍾
